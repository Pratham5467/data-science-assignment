    "# Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write difference between Exception and Syntax Error?\n",
    "In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program.\n",
    "Exceptions are raised when something goes wrong in the program, such as an invalid input, a division by zero,\n",
    "or a file that cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception occurs, Python raises an object of the corresponding exception class, which includes information about the \n",
    "type of error and where it occurred in the code.\n",
    "If an exception is not caught and handled by the program, it will cause the program to terminate and display an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To catch and handle exceptions in Python, you can use a try-except block. \n",
    "This allows you to write code that will try to execute a block of code, and if an exception occurs, \n",
    "it will be caught by the except block and handled accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both exceptions and syntax errors are types of errors that can occur in Python, but they are different in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur when the interpreter is unable to parse the code due to a violation of the language syntax rules.\n",
    "This means that the code does not follow the correct structure and format required by the Python language, and the interpreter \n",
    "is unable to understand and execute it. Examples of syntax errors include missing or incorrect parentheses, colons, or commas,\n",
    "misspelled keywords, and invalid indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, occur when the code is syntactically correct, but an error occurs during the execution of \n",
    "the program. This can happen due to a wide range of reasons, such as invalid input, division by zero, or attempting to access \n",
    "a non-existent object."
