    "# Q3. What is multiple inheritance? Write a python code to demonstrate multiple inheritance.\n",

    "and behaviors from more than one parent class. It means a single class can inherit from multiple base classes \n",
    "and inherit the attributes and methods of all the parent classes. This allows for creating new classes that are\n",

    "# Q4. What are getter and setter in python?Create a class and create a getter and a setter method in this class\n",
    "Ans--In Python, getters and setters are used to define the methods that get and set the values of an \n",
    "object's attributes, respectively. They are used to encapsulate the internal representation of an object,\n",
    "and to ensure that any changes to an object's attributes are properly controlled.\n",

    "A setter method is used to set the value of an object's attribute. It is defined using the @attribute_name.setter\n",

    "# Q5.What is method overriding in python? Write a python code to demonstrate method overriding.\n",
    "Ans--Method overriding in Python refers to the ability of a subclass to provide a new implementation \n",
    "of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "The subclass can override the method of the parent class by defining a method with the same name in the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is called on an object of the subclass, the new implementation in the subclass is executed,\n",
    "instead of the original implementation in the parent class. This allows the subclass to inherit the behavior\n",
    "of the parent class but to customize it as needed."
