    "# Q4 How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "Data abstraction is the process of hiding the underlying complexity of data and presenting it in a simplified form that \n",
    "is easier to understand and use. It can be achieved in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction Layers: Abstraction layers are a set of intermediate representations of data that hide the complexity of \n",
    "the underlying data and present it in a simplified form. For example, an operating system provides an abstraction layer \n",
    "between the hardware and the software, allowing software to interact with the hardware without requiring knowledge of the \n",
    "underlying complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a technique in which the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world,\n",
    "and the object can be manipulated only through a well-defined interface. This allows data to be abstracted and protects it \n",
    "from unintended modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Data Types: Abstract data types are data structures that define a set of operations that can be performed on the data,\n",
    "but hide the underlying implementation details. For example, a stack is an abstract data type that defines the \n",
    "operations \"push\" and \"pop\", but the underlying implementation of the stack could be a linked list, an array, or any other data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces: An interface is a set of rules that define how an object can interact with the outside world. Interfaces allow data to be\n",
    "abstracted by defining the operations that can be performed on the data, but hiding the underlying implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Modularity is the principle of breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable parts. By dividing a system into smaller,\n",
    "more manageable parts, each part can be treated as a separate abstract data type, making the overall system easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these techniques, it's possible to achieve data abstraction and make data easier to use and understand,\n",
    "while hiding the underlying complexity."
