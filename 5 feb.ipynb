    "A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods for modifying their state.\n",

    "3.Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.\n",

    "3.Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.\n",
    "When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object."

Python uses the self parameter to refer to instance attributes and methods of the class.The self variable in Python can also be used to access a variable field within the class definition.\n",
    "The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the  syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically.\n",
